    <h1>A few facts about Karachi</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>The First Capital</strong><br />
      Karachi was the first capital of Pakistan and it made sense since it’s the
      major trade hub and port for the country. But, Karachi lost its title as
      the capital of Pakistan when Islamabad became the capital in August of
      1967.

    <p>
      <strong>Karachi Has A Huge Population</strong><br />
      Karachi has a seriously large population and is home to around 15 million
      residents, that’s double the population of London. It’s the most populated
      city in Pakistan and the 6th most populated city in the entire world.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>A City Of Immigrants</strong><br />
      Karachi, which we now know has an extremely large population, is also home
      to millions of immigrants. The city is thought to be home to a million
      Bengalis, half a million people from Burmese Rohingya, and hundreds of
      thousands of Afghans, Africans, Philippinos, Chinses, Iranians, and more.
      The city is a serious cultural melting pot.

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Religious Diversity</strong><br />
      Due to its unique location in the world, bridging the Middle East to Asia,
      and of course, being an ex-British colony, Karachi is a melting pot of
      religious diversity. You can find almost every religion on the planet in
      Karachi amongst its huge population.Muslims, Christians, Catholics,
      Christian, Hindus, Baha’i, and ancient Parsi believers all live side by
      side in relative harmony.
